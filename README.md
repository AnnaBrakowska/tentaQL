TentaQL is an open-source, automated SQL (Postrges and MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB) introspection and GraphQL conversion tool, providing users a highly customizable GraphQL package to get their legacy databases up and running with GraphQL in minutes.  

By visiting our easy-to-use browser app (currently Chrome-compatible) at Tentaql.com -- no complicated logins required, just a simple database URI -- TentaQL introspects schematic data and assembles a lightweight zip package for running a tailor-made GraphQL sandbox environment for the user's database. The zip comes complete with core CRUD query/mutation functionality and support for complex relationships, all while leveraging GraphiQL, an industry-leading visualization tool. For more experienced users, TentaQL also offers in-browser editibility to further customize queries/mutations/subscriptions prior to download.

While there are currently several fantastic providers offering similar schema-introspection for legacy databases -- notably, Prisma and Postgraphile -- the initial setup for these services can be prohibitively time-consuming, involving heavy downloads, and a steep learning curve for teams new to the GraphQL environment looking for a simple, speedy experimentation tool for potential migration to GraphQL.

# How to use

Paste your database address in the URL box, and click "Convert your DB". (Note: If running your Database locally, please use your IP address as 'host' and allow all remote connections)

Your database is converted to GraphQL language. You should now see the schema.

You can use tabs located above the code editor to switch the view between schema and resolvers.
You can also:
* download converted files by clicking on "Download Original Zip"
* edit schema or resolvers and download edited files by clicking on "Download Edited Zip"
* reset schema or resolvers to it's original state by clicking on "Reset Tab" or reset schema and resolvers by clicking on "Reset All"
* copy chosen tab by clicking on "Copy Tab"
